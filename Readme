You have reached my pd_vanilla_sequencer repo.

This is a targeted creation that will use exclusively tools that belong to the Pure Data vanilla family.

It is meant to be used by anybody, and can be customized at will to fit the individual user's needs.

The goal is to have bi-weekly updates, until the main functions are complete.
