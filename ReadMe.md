### Read this file!

You have reached my pd_vanilla_sequencer repo.

This is a targeted creation that will use **exclusively** tools that belong to the Pure Data vanilla family.

#### Terms
PD = Pure Data

#### Why Pure Data Vanilla?
PD Vanilla is the easiest to implement, since it does not require additional tools to be built. A default installation of PD will include any of the tools used in the patches found in this repository.
Additionally, this serves as a good starting point for all those interested in exploring the sequencing capabilites without resorting to external tools.

#### Why open to all?
Well, PD is free.
It is meant to be used by anybody, and can be customized at will to fit the individual user's needs.
Therefore, the information in this repository will follow suit.

#### Goals
1. The main goal is to provide a ready-to-use text-based sequencer for all uses within PD.
2. A secondary goal is to provide some insight on how a non-programmer approaches a rather technical process.
3. A third goal is to have a repository for tools that the original creator uses regularly, and have some form of version control over them, without being entirely dependent on local copies.

#### Where to start
Feel free to browse anything in this repository.
Grab any part that feels that it will be of help to your current programming needs.

A wiki is under development, which will provide more details about the use of the sequencer.
