### Read this file!

You have reached my pd_vanilla_sequencer repo.

This is a targeted creation that will use exclusively tools that belong to the Pure Data vanilla family.

#### Terms
PD = Pure Data

#### Why Pure Data Vanilla?
PD Vanilla is the easiest to implement, since it does not require additional tools to be built. A default installation of PD will include any of the tools used in the patches found in this repository.

#### Why open to all?
Well, PD is free.
It is meant to be used by anybody, and can be customized at will to fit the individual user's needs.
Therefore, the information in this repository will follow suit.

#### Goals
The goal is to have bi-weekly updates, until the main functions are complete.
After this, any update will be published _when ready_.

#### Where to start
Feel free to browse anything in this repository.
Grab any part that feels that it will be of help to your current programming needs.
