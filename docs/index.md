## Welcome to a Pure Data Vanilla sequencer

This is a sequencer constructed for learning purposes primarily.

It can be used to control any Pure Data (or Purr Data) project, through a very simple `qlist` manipulation.

There is a provision for the use of a presenter, or clicker.

More information to come!
